\section{Introduction}
%\tr{I show that carbon taxes are only efficient if lump-sum transfers are available.}

\begin{comment}
\tr{Think about:
	1) when labor income taxes are not used, then need to have  a higher environmental tax to meet emission limits? \ar Yes, because of advantageous level effect which outweighs recomposing effect of income tax.
	2) When staying at level optimal under the assumption of lump-sum redistribution, but then not redistributing, than absent labor income tax emissions are too high; by how much? Counterfactual}

\paragraph{Outline}
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:mod_an} presents the core model and the analytical results. In Section \ref{sec:model2}, I extend and calibrate the model to a quantitative framework.  Results are discussed in Section \ref{sec:res}. Section \ref{sec:con} concludes.

%The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section \ref{sec:mod_an} presents a tractable model which is used to derive the analytical results in section \ref{sec:theory}. In section \ref{sec:model}, I extend the model to a quantitative framework and calibrate it. I present and discuss the quantitative results in section \ref{sec:res}. Section \ref{sec:con} concludes.
